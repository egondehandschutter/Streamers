Streamer app
==================================
This app contains a list with streamers who play chess on the site chess.com. Streamers can stream on twitch.tv or elsewhere. 
If the streamer is live on twitch.tv, this will be visible in the list with an icon and the streamer will be put on the top of the list.
On a particicular streamer can then be clicked to see more details and 2 intents to go to the streamers twitch.tv profile or chess.com profile.
The twitch.tv intent will not be enabled when the streamer does not have a twitch.
The app serves it purpose when a user wants to watch a chess stream and needs to know who is online. This can be to discover a new chess streamer or
to see that their favourite chess streamer is online. The api that is used to create the application as described is
the published chess.com api https://api.chess.com/pub/streamers.
